This project is related to the Boston house price prediction using The Boston house-price data of Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.
Description of the parameters considered in this dataset are mentioned in the text files. 
We have performed exploratory data analysis in order to understand the various parameters that affect the prices of housing in Boston. Then we have also performed some data preprocessing in order to make the data clean and fit for performing the predictions. Based on the root mean squared error in the predictions using cross validation, we then tried to compare variious models to decide which one would be most suitable for making these predictions.
Hyper Parametric tuning has also been carried out to further improve these models.
The results obtained by using various models have been documented in this project.
